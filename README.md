## Certification Project: Markdown Previewer
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

Create a Markdown Previewer, a web application designed for developers and writers alike. Built with React, it allows users to input Markdown syntax — a lightweight markup language used to format plain text — and instantly see a live preview of how it will render as HTML.
